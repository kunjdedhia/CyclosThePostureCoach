Preventing Low Back Pain among cyclists using the Autoregressive Model
# Inspiration
As an endurance road cyclist, I, myself, suffer low back pain on rides that last more than a 100 miles. I realized apart from buying the correct bike, interestingly researchers show that muscle fatigue among cyclists worsens their spine posture. An inappropriate spine posture could lead to a Chronic Low Back Pain or a Herniated Fibrous Disc causing pain. Well, numbers speak for themselves; of the 85% of cyclists who report injury every year, 30.3% require medical treatment for low back pain (The American Journal of Sports Medicine & The International Journal of Sports Medicine)
